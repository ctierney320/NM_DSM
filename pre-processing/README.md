## Pre-Processing Infromation

**Pedon_Org** has been updated for the new data recieved in 2024 and is mostly organized for sharing.
- The full NASIS dataset is stored at V:/PROJECTS/TRAVIS_NAUMAN/NM_DSM/Data_Spatial/Natl_Pedons/
- The KSSL data snapshot ("KSSL_Export") was downloaded from https://ncss-tech.github.io/lab-data-delivery/SDA.html in May 2022
- Legacy data is directly from Colby Brungard (cbrung@nmsu.edu)

The raster-organizing code (/earth-engine and /stack_clip) documents in this folder were used in the NM DSM project before 2023. They have not been especially cleaned or organized for sharing. They are provided as resources to understanding the project's processes.
